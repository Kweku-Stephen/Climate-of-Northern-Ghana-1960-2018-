# Climate-of-Northern-Ghana-1960-2018-
I begun this project within my first month of learning R programming. These were the early stages of my R journey. some expressions and syntaxes may seem absurd, this is because I was learning and I still am.
The Project is a description of the Climate(Rainfall and Temperature) of Northern Ghana (Savannah, Northern, Upper East and Upper West Regions) from the years 1960 - 2018. It involves the use of meteorological data (without raster) from all weather stations in the North of the country.
